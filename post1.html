                        <p>You've decided to start investing. That's huge. Most people never even get this far.</p>

                        <p>Then reality hits.</p>

                        <p>You open a brokerage app, hear people talking about 401(k)s, Roth IRAs, HSAs, and suddenly it feels like you need a finance degree just to make your first move. You don't want to mess it up. You don't want to put your money in the "wrong" place.</p>

                        <p>Here's the good news: there is no perfect first choice. There is, however, a smart order — and once you understand it, everything clicks.</p>

                        <p>Let's break down where your money should actually go when you're just getting started.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">HSA (Health Savings Account)</h2>

                        <p>If you qualify for an HSA, this is one of the most powerful places your money can go — and most beginners don't realize it.</p>

                        <p>An HSA is only available if you're enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). That eligibility requirement matters. Without an HDHP, you can't open or contribute to this account.</p>

                        <p>If you are eligible, the tax advantages are unmatched.</p>

                        <p><strong>An HSA has a triple tax advantage:</strong></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Contributions can reduce your taxable income</li>
                            <li>Investment growth is tax-free</li>
                            <li>Withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified medical expenses</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>No other account combines all three.</p>

                        <p>HSAs have annual contribution caps that depend on whether you have individual or family coverage, with an additional catch-up amount allowed later in life. You can't contribute unlimited amounts, but the limits are high enough to make this account extremely valuable over time.</p>

                        <p>Here's the long-term strategy most people miss. You don't have to spend the money as you contribute it. If you pay medical expenses out of pocket and invest the HSA funds instead, the account can grow for decades.</p>

                        <p>After age 65, HSA funds can be withdrawn for non-medical expenses. These withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, similar to a Traditional IRA. Withdrawals used for medical expenses remain tax-free.</p>

                        <p>That means the HSA can function as both a healthcare account and a retirement account.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">401(k)</h2>

                        <p>If you have a job and your employer offers a 401(k), this is usually the most natural starting point.</p>

                        <p>A 401(k) allows you to invest directly from your paycheck. This automatic setup removes a lot of friction when you're new to investing.</p>

                        <p>The biggest advantage is the employer match. If your employer matches part of what you contribute, that's free money. It's an instant return with zero risk. Skipping the match is one of the most expensive mistakes new investors make.</p>

                        <p><strong>Most 401(k)s are traditional by default:</strong></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Contributions lower your taxable income today</li>
                            <li>Investments grow tax-deferred</li>
                            <li>Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Many employers also offer a Roth 401(k):</strong></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Contributions are made with after-tax dollars</li>
                            <li>Investment growth is tax-free</li>
                            <li>Qualified withdrawals are tax-free</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>401(k)s have much higher contribution caps than IRAs, which makes them especially powerful as your income increases. The trade-off is flexibility. Investment choices are limited to what the plan offers, and early withdrawals usually trigger taxes and penalties.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Traditional IRA</h2>

                        <p>A Traditional IRA is an individual retirement account that you open on your own, outside of your employer.</p>

                        <p>This account gives you more control over your investments than a typical 401(k), but the tax benefits depend on your income and whether you have access to a workplace retirement plan.</p>

                        <p>Contributions may be tax-deductible. When they are, you lower your taxable income today while pushing taxes into the future.</p>

                        <p>The money grows tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes on gains as they compound. When you withdraw the money in retirement, it's taxed as ordinary income.</p>

                        <p>Traditional IRAs have lower contribution caps than 401(k)s, but they're useful for people who want more flexibility or who expect to be in a lower tax bracket later in life.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Roth IRA</h2>

                        <p>For many beginners, this is the most intuitive place to start investing.</p>

                        <p>A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax money. You don't get a tax deduction today. Instead, you're buying future freedom.</p>

                        <p>Your investments grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. That includes all of the gains.</p>

                        <p>Roth IRAs have annual contribution caps and income limits. As your income grows, these limits can reduce or eliminate your ability to contribute directly.</p>

                        <p>One of the biggest advantages for beginners is flexibility. You can withdraw your contributions (not earnings) at any time without penalties. That makes the Roth IRA feel less restrictive than other retirement accounts.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">A smart order for getting started</h2>

                        <p>You don't need to use every account at once. A simple priority order works for most people.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Start with a 401(k) up to the employer match.</li>
                            <li>If you're eligible, contribute to an HSA.</li>
                            <li>Build long-term tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.</li>
                            <li>Add more to your 401(k) as income increases.</li>
                            <li>Use a Traditional IRA when it fits your tax situation.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Even following the first two steps puts you ahead of the majority of investors.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Final takeaway</h2>

                        <p>When you're new to investing, the hardest part isn't choosing investments — it's choosing where to put your money.</p>

                        <p>You don't need to make the perfect decision. You just need to make an informed one and start building momentum. Once your system is in place, investing becomes far simpler.</p>

                        <p><strong>Your first move doesn't need to be flawless. It just needs to exist.</strong></p>
